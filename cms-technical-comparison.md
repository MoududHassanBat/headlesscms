**Technical Notes:**

1. **Query Performance Metrics** (typical for medium dataset):
   - REST: 50-200ms average response time
   - GraphQL: 100-300ms for complex queries
   - GROQ: 70-250ms average response time

2. **Scaling Thresholds** (approximate):
   - Content Items: 100k-1M before performance degradation
   - API Requests: 100-1000 req/s before throttling
   - Asset Storage: 100GB-1TB before significant cost implications

3. **Common Technical Debt Areas:**
   - Content type schema migrations
   - Caching strategy complexity
   - API version management
   - Asset pipeline optimization
   - Authentication/authorization scaling

4. **Resource Requirements** (minimum production):
   - Self-hosted: 2-4 CPU cores, 4-8GB RAM
   - Database: 10-50GB storage initially
   - Cache Layer: 1-2GB RAM for Redis
   - Asset Storage: Scales with content
